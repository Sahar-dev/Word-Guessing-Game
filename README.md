# Word-Guessing-Game
The project is a game that allows you to first define two player names.
Once defined, an arbitrary question is displayed. Each player will have in turn to answer this question by filling the empty spaces. If the answer is correct he will get +1, otherwise a 0.

The characters proposed each time can be at the beginning of the word, in the middle, at the end etc. arbitrary too. If the number of characters exceeds 12, three characters will be proposed, if between 9 and 12 two characters will be proposed otherwise only one character.
The player who reaches 10 first will win.

All questions and associated answers are saved in an XML file that the game administrator will feed via his space.
